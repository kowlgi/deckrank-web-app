            h4 What is deckrank?
            |It's a simple tool that lets you quickly create a poll,
            |get multiple people to vote and see the poll results.

            h4 In what situations will I need deckrank?
            |Here's an example.
            |I want to have lunch with a group of friends.
            |To help coordinate, I do the following:
            ol
                li Create a poll with different options for meeting time
                li Create another poll with restaurant options
                li Get my friends to vote on the above polls
            |Voila! Now, my friends and I will be able to see the poll results.
            |In a deckrank-less universe, this would've turned into a
            |chaotic chain of emails.

            h4 I kind of get the idea, could you show me some polls so I can explain it to my grandmother?
