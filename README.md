# DeckRank (May - July 2015)

## Intro
Deckrank, hosted at https://deckrank.co was a web app that people could use to set up ranking polls.

## Usage
Users could set up a poll asking a question like, "which restaurant do you prefer for dinner?" and list 4 options. Responders could open the poll URL and rank the 4 options. The highest ranked options would then we displayed on the poll.

## User base
It hosted about 250 polls. Around 960 people either created a poll or voted.

## Challenges
* Very hard to market it as it was not differentiated. Found it a steep challenge getting the word out that it exists. Posted on show HN, response was ok.
* It didn’t require sign up —  “no pressure ux”. This resulted in non-committed users.

## Tech stack
* Server: Node.js/Express, MongoDB, mailgun API for email notifications
* Client: Vanilla JS, CSS, HTML template written in Jade
